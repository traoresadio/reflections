hello Here are some refelctions

in order to view the differentes commits you navigate to where the code is 
and type the command " git log "

questions:
1. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	because in software project there are ususally multiple files and those file are linked one to another.

2. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	the git log command allows you to view the history of commits of files (the id of commits, the person and the comments made) then you will have a view of how your file changed.

	the "git diff  id_old  id_New" and the "git diff  --stat id_old  id_New" allows you to compa	re two commits by their id. And it shows you the differences (line added or deleted).


3. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

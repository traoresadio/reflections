1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When i am working with other programmers or to keep my project safe from any damage that could 
  happen to my computer.


2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	because someone else could be using the remote repository. so we wanna master what we want to bring to our local repository.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks:
		it copies the contents of someone else's repository into yours and only applies to "gitHub"(remote)
	clone:
		it copies the contents in your git hub repository to your local machine(working directory)
	branches:
		it is a set of commits, think of it as a real branch in a tree.
